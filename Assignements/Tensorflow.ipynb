We haven't talked about validation sets before, but their intent is to be used for model selection. So you'd use validation data to select your model, train the model with the training set, and then evaluate the model using the test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to the concept of train/test - it's important to evaluate the performance of our neural network using data it's never seen before. Otherwise it's kinda like giving students a math test for problems they already have the answers for. So, we use a completely different set of images to train our neural network from the images used for testing its accuracy.\n",

    "The test data is encoded as \"one_hot\" when we loaded it above. Think of one_hot as a binary representation of the label data - that is, which number each handwriting sample was intended to represent. Mathematically one_hot represents a dimension for every possible label value. Every dimension is set to the value 0, except for the \"correct\" one which is set to 1. For example, the label vector representing the number 1 would be [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (remember we start counting at 0.) It's just a format that's optimized for how the labels are applied during training.\n",
